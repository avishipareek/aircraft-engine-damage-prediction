# aircraft-engine-damage-prediction
This is a data science and machine learning project aimed at predicting aircraft engine damage. The project utilizes several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The dataset consists of operational data from aircraft engines, and the goal is to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and potential engine failure.
